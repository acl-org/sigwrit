<b>Overview</b><br><br>

<p>
Events sponsored by the SIG will focus on research addressing the
relationship between written and spoken language, the properties of
written language, the ways in which writing systems encode language,
and applications specifically focused on characteristics of writing
systems.
</p>

<p>
Most work on NLP focuses on language in its canonical written form. 
This has often led researchers to ignore the differences between 
written and spoken language or, worse, to conflate the two. 
Instances of conflation are statements like "Chinese is a logographic language" or 
"Persian is a right-to-left language", variants of which can be found frequently 
in the ACL anthology (<a href="https://aclanthology.org/2023.cawl-1.1/">Gorman & Sproat, 2023)</a>. 
These statements confuse properties of the language with properties of its writing system. 
Ignoring differences between written and spoken language leads, among other things, 
to conflating different words that are spelled the same (e.g., English <em>bass</em>), 
or treating as different, words that have multiple spellings (e.g., Japanese <em>umai</em> 'tasty', 
which can be written 旨い, うまい, ウマい, or 美味い).
</p>

<p>
Furthermore, methods for dealing with written language issues 
(e.g., various kinds of normalization or conversion) or for 
recognizing text input (e.g. OCR &amp; handwriting recognition 
or text entry methods) are often regarded as precursors to 
NLP rather than as fundamental parts of the enterprise, despite the fact 
that most NLP methods rely centrally on representations derived from text 
rather than (spoken) language. This general lack of consideration of writing 
has led to much of the research on such topics to largely appear outside of ACL venues, 
in conferences or journals of neighboring fields such as speech technology 
(e.g., text normalization) or human-computer interaction (e.g., text entry).    
</p>

<p>
Topics of interest covered within the scope of the SIG and its
sponsored events will include (but not be limited to): text entry;
text tokenization; disambiguation of abbreviations and homographs;
grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, transliteration, and diacritization;
text normalization for speech and for processing “informal” genres of
text; the computational study of literary devices involving writing
systems, such as eye dialect; information-theoretic and
machine-learning approaches to decipherment; methods for specialized
text genres, e.g., clinical notes; optical character (incl.
handwriting) recognition and historical document processing;
orthographic representation for unwritten languages; spelling error
detection and correction; script normalization and encoding; and
writing system typology and its relevance to speech and language
processing.
