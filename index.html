Events sponsored by the SIG will focus on research addressing the
relationship between written and spoken language, the properties of
written language, the ways in which writing systems encode language,
and applications specifically focused on characteristics of writing
systems.<br><br>

<b>Pending events</b>:<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://sigwrit.org/workshops/cawl2024/">Second Workshop on Computation and Written Language (CAWL 2024)</a></li>
</ul><br>
<b>Past events</b>:<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://cawl.wellformedness.com/">ACL Workshop on Computation and Written Language (CAWL) 2023</a></li>
</ul><br>

Topics of interest covered within the scope of the SIG and its
sponsored events will include (but not be limited to): text entry;
text tokenization; disambiguation of abbreviations and homographs;
grapheme-to-phoneme conversion, transliteration, and diacritization;
text normalization for speech and for processing “informal” genres of
text; the computational study of literary devices involving writing
systems, such as eye dialect; information-theoretic and
machine-learning approaches to decipherment; methods for specialized
text genres, e.g., clinical notes; optical character (incl.
handwriting) recognition and historical document processing;
orthographic representation for unwritten languages; spelling error
detection and correction; script normalization and encoding; and
writing system typology and its relevance to speech and language
processing.
